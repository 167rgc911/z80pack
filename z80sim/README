The SIO port implemented is compatible with MITS SIO Rev. 1, so that
all software using it runs on this machine.

Also port 255, which is used by frontpanel machines for system
configuration, can be set with the p command to any desired value,
the default is 0.

For MITS BASIC Versions < 4.0 the port 255 value needs to be 0, for
Versions >= 4.0 the correct setting is 22H.
