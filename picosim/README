To build you need to have the SDK for RP2040-based devices installed and
configured. The SDK manual has detailed instructions how to install on
all major PC platforms, it is available here:

https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html

We are going to use a MicroSD drive for 8080/Z80 code files, disk images
and configration files. This requires an additional library to talk to
such devices with SPI. The library is setup as submodule in z80pack,
if you wish to build this here you need to download the lib. You can
either clone z80pack with this command:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/udo-munk/z80pack.git

or if you cloned already without pulling submodules you can add it with:

	cd z80pack
	git submodule update --init

Now you can build picosim with these commands:

	cd z80pack/picosim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

To clean everything:

	cd z80pack/picosim
	rm -rf build

This machine can be used with Pico and Pico W boards, but you might need to
uncomment/comment/modify some lines in CMakeLists.txt and sim.h properly
for the board used. I'm using a Pico W, so everything setup for this one.

Terminal I/O is going to the pin 1/2 UART, so you need a debug probe or
some TTL to USB adapter. I also tried using the USB UART, but didn't get
it fully working, needs more research.


Preparing a MicroSD card:
In the root directory of the card create these directories:
CONF80
CODE80
DISKS80

Into the CODE80 directory copy all the .bin files from src-examples.
Into the DISKS80 directory copy the CP/M disk images from disks.
In CONF80 create an empty text file CFG.TXT.
