This can be used with Pico and Pico W boards, but you need to uncomment/comment
some lines in CMakeLists.txt and sim.h properly for the board used.

To build you need to have the SDK for RP2040-based devices installed and
configured, then do:

	cd z80pack/picosim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

To clean everything:

	cd z80pack/picosim
	rm -rf build
