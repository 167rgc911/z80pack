This is a research machine that contains:

	Z80 or 8080 CPU
	64 KB RAM
	UART for serial communication with a terminal

Not much compared to the other machines, it is used for:

	better isolation of modules for usage on bare metal
	memory optimizations for very small bare metal
	overall perfomance analysis on very small hardware

So this is a proof of concept to jump start other more usefull
machines from here.

This can be used with Pico and Pico W boards, but you might need to
uncomment/comment/modify some lines in CMakeLists.txt and sim.h properly
for the board used. I'm using a Pico W, so everything setup for this one.

To build you need to have the SDK for RP2040-based devices installed and
configured, then do:

	cd z80pack/picosim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

To clean everything:

	cd z80pack/picosim
	rm -rf build

Terminal I/O is going to the pin 1/2 UART, so you need a debug probe or
some TTL to USB adapter. I also tried using the USB UART, but didn't get
it fully working, needs more research.
