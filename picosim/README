This is work in progress and won't do anything yet, for developers only!
To build you need to have the SDK for RP2040-based devices installed and
configured.

	cd z80pack/picosim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

Trying to get a z80pack system running on a Raspberry Pi Pico (W) board.
What I can say so far is that the Z80 core cleanly compiles with the SDK
and that the produced binary is small. More to come sometime ...
