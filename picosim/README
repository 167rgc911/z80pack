This can be used with Pico and Pico W boards, but you might need to uncomment/comment
some lines in CMakeLists.txt and sim.h properly for the board used. I'm using a Pico W,
so everything setup for this one.

To build you need to have the SDK for RP2040-based devices installed and
configured, then do:

	cd z80pack/picosim
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make

To clean everything:

	cd z80pack/picosim
	rm -rf build

Terminal I/O is going to the pin 1/2 UART, so you need a debug probe or some TTL to USB
adapter. I also tried using the USB UART, but didn't get it fully working, needs more
research.
