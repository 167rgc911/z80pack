This directory contains Z80 code examples for the Pico Z80.
I have assembled the sources with z80asm from z80pack, but you
can use any Z80/8080 assembler of course. Advantage of using
z80asm is, that the latest version can output C code we can
right use here, without the need to convert from binaries or
hex dumps.

Copy one of the "example".c files to ../z80code.h and rebuild
the application.

The examples are:
serial.c	- shows how to do serial I/O
tb.c		- TINY BASIC
