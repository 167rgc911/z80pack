This directory contains Z80 code examples for the Pico Z80.
I have assembled the sources with z80asm from z80pack, but you
can use any Z80 assembler of course. Advantage of using z80asm
is, that the latest version can output C code we can right use
here, without the need to convert from binaries or hex dumps.

Copy one of the "example".c files to ../z80code.h and rebuild
the application.
