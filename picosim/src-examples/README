This directory contains Z80 code examples for the Pico Z80.
I have assembled the sources with z80asm from z80pack, but you
can use any Z80/8080 assembler of course. Advantage of using
z80asm is, that the latest version can output C code we can
right use here, without the need to convert from binaries or
hex dumps.

With z80pack z80sim examples like these can be debugged under
control of an In Circuit Emulator (debug probe), the serial
port implemented in the latest release is identical.

Copy one of the "example".c files to ../z80code.h and rebuild
the application.

The examples are:
serial.c	- shows how to do serial I/O
tb.c		- TINY BASIC
micro80.c	- 8080 Microchess
blink.c		- blink builtin LED with Z80 port output
