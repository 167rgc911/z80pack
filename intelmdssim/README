This is a simulator for the Intel Intellec MDS-800 system.

The front panel picture (conf/intelmds.jpg) comes from the front page
of https://www.facebook.com/groups/IntellecMDS .

The monitor ROM source code comes from the files
monitors/MDS-I/{b1v12.asm,m1v20.asm} out of
Bill Beech's https://www.nj7p.info/Computers/work/Intel-run.7z .
It was compared to
https://mark-ogden.uk/files/intel/publications/9800155D%20Intellec%20MDS%20Monitor%20V2.0-SEP75.pdf
and corrected (lots of OCR errors in the comments) and produces the same code
(except for filler bytes) as the files in
http://bitsavers.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/pdf/intel/MDS800/firmware/ .

The CP/M disk image was downloaded from
https://www.nj7p.info/Computers/Old%20Software/software.html .

The ISIS II 4.3 system disk image was created with Mark Ogden's disk tools and his
incredible ISIS file and disk recipe repository.
The file "@II-System Disk" contains the custom disk image recipe that was used.
