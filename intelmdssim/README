This will be a simulator for the Intel Intellec MDS-800 system.

The front panel picture (conf/intelmds.jpg) comes from the front page
of https://www.facebook.com/groups/IntellecMDS .

The LED graphics are unfortunately hard coded in the front panel library,
and don't look like the real thing.

Currently you can play with the switches. More to come.
